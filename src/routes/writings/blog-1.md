ðŸŽ£ You got click-baited if you think I'll teach you to stalk :) This blog covers what is an RSS feed & how I use it to keep up with personal blogs.

## What is an RSS Feed ?

> RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. - Wikipedia

Certain websites (like this one) have what is called an RSS feed. Let's say (for argument sake) you like my blog and you read all of them. And you want to read more of my blogs as I upload them. So now you are waiting for these new blogs to be uploaded. So, you visit my website every few days to check if a new blog was posted.

Instead of coming to my website, visiting the blog section and scrolling to see if there was a new blog. You can just check my feed.

If you visit the link, [commitsovercoffee.com/rss](https://commitsovercoffee.com/rss). You will see a list of all my blogs.
This list of blog names & descriptions that you see, is called an RSS feed.

RSS feeds are widely used by individuals & companies alike. And there are apps called RSS readers using which you can subscribe to these feeds.

## How to use an RSS reader app.

Now that you know that something like RSS feeds exist. Let's install an RSS reader and add some feeds to it, to give you a sense of how it works ...

1. Install an RSS reader app on your phone such as [feeder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play&pcampaignid=web_share).
2. "Add" some feeds to the app such as :
   - https://commitsovercoffee.com/rss
   - https://techcrunch.com/feed
   - https://hamvocke.com/feed.xml
3. Checkout the populated feed.
4. Read the blogs at your leisure.

The app itself will periodically check if new blogs were added to any of your feeds. So you don't need to refresh & check if there is something new. You can carry on with your life and the app will ping you when there is something new.

## How I use RSS.

I like to think & use certain digital solutions like an appliance. They have a fixed place where I use them. For reading blogs, I like to have an RSS reader on my phone, that's all. When I'm on my desktop or laptop I'm probably doing something very specific so I don't have an RSS reader on those machines. So, my phone is my dedicated reading space.

I'm not active on any social media sites. But ofcourse there are folks I'd like to keep up with. Thankfully, most of these people have personal websites or blogs. So I subscribe to their feeds and read 'em at my leisure.

The beauty of this approach is that it has no ads. And when you subscribe to someone's personal blog. It is some person ( who is probably working full-time ), who is taking some time out to write a blog. So you receive only a few blogs every month (atleast that's how its been for me). A few well put blogs are anyways better than a thousand social media posts on the same topic.

I use RSS to follow along with personal blogs and my experience has been superb. Your experience however, can easily be ruined if you add feeds from (say) a media outlet, who will bombard you with 100 feeds everyday. Although you can set how many feeds you want to see per day, it ruins the experience.

RSS is just a tool for content curation, it is ofcourse on us to use it wisely.

## Why isn't everyone using RSS ?

RSS works great (mostly), if you know what you want.

- For someone new to this, they will have to curate their own feed & that can feel daunting. Especially in this social media era where we are just so habitual of content been fed to us by algorithms vs taking sometime to curate our content.
- Even if you decide to take the time to curate your feed, not everyone has RSS on their blog or website. Nothing we can do about that. May be mail them to add one ? ðŸ˜…

## That's all folks !

I have met few people who didn't know about RSS (despite not being gen-z) and were thrilled to know about it and use it everyday. Hence wrote this blog as an homage to RSS, a beautiful piece of tech. Or shall I call it a relic from the past. Haha.
